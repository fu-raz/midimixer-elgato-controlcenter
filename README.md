# Elgato Control Center Plugin

A proof of concept again, just testing if we can connect to an Elgato light and turn it on/off, adjust the brightness and color temperature. I only have an Elgato Key Light and Key Light Air available for testing and so far they seem to work.

## What's working

- Connecting to Elgato Control Center (tested with v1.3.2)
- Detecting lights and creating sliders for brightness (mute button is on/off) and color temperature

## Notes

My own Key Light Air keeps disconnecting/connecting, so I don't delete the controls on disconnect right now. I don't think this will be a problem, but there's no easy way to notify the user that the light (might have) disconnected.
